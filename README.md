- <b>Capstone Project: Dating App For Animal Adoption (Pawsome)</b>
<p>Pawsome is a pet adoption web application designed to connect animals with their furever home.</p>
<p>The application allows potential adopters to create accounts, select pet preferences, and start matching with their future pet.</p>
<p>Animal shelter admins can register, upload pet profiles, and manage pet profiles through a designated dashboard. 
<p>Built using Next.js, Typescript, and Directus for the backend, the platform enables a simple way to find pets from multiple shelters in a central place.</p>
